# galaxy-pack0.1
# plz note this pack is made for 1.8.9
# sry, but no mac/linux install guide.
# plz follow my insta @analogchip for all of the struggles i went thru to get this to work. Right now, only the gui is galaxy, but soon, there's gonna be armour and swords.
How to install:
1. copy the zip
2. Hold down the windows key+r at the same time. This will pull up a run box
3. in the run box, type in [%appdata%] (not including the ['s].
4. go into the .minecraft folder
5. next, go into the resourcepacks folder
6. paste it.
7. open minecraft.
8. go into your settings
9. go into the texture pack page
10. hover your mouse over the pack (it has a picure of a noob)
11. click the arrow to move it over.
12. Enjoy!



plz note i took some textures from acidicblitzz, timedeo 1.3, and zyph default. Plz note that i made the gui, blocks, and most of the buttons.
